            <p>It’s difficult to imagine just how far away from the sun the planet Neptune is. But it’s about 4.5 billion km away, which means that if you could drive at 80 km per hour through space, it would take you more than 6,000 years to reach it.</p>
            <p>At this enormous distance, it takes Neptune 165 Earth years to go all the way around the sun once. </p>
            <p>Dark vortexes and bright clouds sometimes appear in Neptune’s deep blue atmosphere. Fierce winds whip through the planet’s thick atmosphere, which is made up of hydrogen and helium, along with other gases like methane. Neptune is made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. The tremendous temperatures and pressures inside Neptune make some scientists think that diamonds could be forming and swirling through the planet’s hidden depths. Imagine rain made of diamonds!</p>
